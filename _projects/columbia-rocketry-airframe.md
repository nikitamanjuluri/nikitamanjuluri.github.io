As Airframe Lead for Columbia Space Initiative's rocket team, I was responsible for the structural performance and fabrication of the fin can for our competition launch vehicle at Spaceport America. This included composite layup manufacturing, CNC machining, waterjet cutting, and integration with propulsion, recovery, and avionics systems.

My role combined design, simulation, hands-on fabrication, documentation, and coordination across multiple subteams to ensure a manufacturable, high-strength, and competition-ready fin assembly.

## Challenge

Our goal was to manufacture a high-strength, lightweight fin can using composite layups capable of withstanding aerodynamic and launch loads while minimizing mass and fabrication complexity.

Key objectives included:

- Create structural fins using composite manufacturing techniques
- Ensure adhesion and strength at fin-to-body interfaces
- Maintain dimensional accuracy and surface quality
- Integrate with the rest of the launch vehicle
- Complete within competition timeline and resource constraints

## Fin Layup Manufacturing

We produced the fins using vacuum-bagged carbon fiber over G10 fiberglass stock.

**Process:**

1. Lay up six layers of carbon fiber reinforced with epoxy
2. Stack composite layers with:
   - Release film
   - Breather layer
   - Vacuum nipple
   - Vacuum bagging
3. Full cure for 12 hours
4. Cut the fin profile using a waterjet
5. Bevel the fin edges using a CNC mill and fixture setup

This approach allowed us to mass-reduce the fins while achieving high structural stiffness and rigidity.

## Tip-to-Tip Layups

To improve fin-to-airframe bonding and stiffness, we used "tip-to-tip" reinforcement, bonding the fins directly to the body tube before a secondary composite wrap.

**Process:**

1. Jig the vehicle in place and tack fins using quick-set epoxy
2. Apply three reinforcing composite overlays:
   - Original cut size
   - +0.3 inch offset
   - +0.6 inch offset
3. Apply carbon fiber and resin
4. Vacuum bag and cure 12 hours

This significantly strengthened the load path into the airframe and improved resistance to aerodynamic flutter.

## Tools & Techniques Used

**Composite Airframe Manufacturing:**
- Carbon fiber & epoxy layups
- Vacuum bagging
- Composite curing cycles

**Machining & Fabrication:**
- Waterjet cutting
- CNC milling
- Custom jig and fixture setup

**Simulation & Design Tools:**
- OpenRocket for stability and drag estimation
- ANSYS Fluent CFD for nosecone, boattail, and shroud analysis

## Key Learnings

- Flight dynamics (center of pressure & center of gravity balancing)
- Payload & avionics (mounting, internal clearances)
- Propulsion (thermal and vibration concerns)
- Recovery systems (structural load paths during parachute deployment)
- Robust documentation is essential for iteration and handoff
- Composites deliver exceptional performance, but manufacturing variability must be controlled
- Integration is as critical as structure—communication between subteams determines success
- Creative use of available manufacturing processes can replace more expensive tooling
