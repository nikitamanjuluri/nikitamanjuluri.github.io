## Overview

As part of our senior design group, we focused on redesigning the outsoles of female soccer cleats with the goal of reducing non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. Recognizing that standard cleat designs may not fully account for biomechanical differences and injury risk in female players, our project aimed to rethink outsole geometry, stud layout, and material interactions with the playing surface to improve safety, stability, and performance for women athletes.

## Challenge

Traditional soccer cleat outsoles are often designed without gender-specific biomechanics in mind, which can exacerbate rotational forces on knees during cutting, pivoting, and rapid direction changes — contributing to a higher risk of ACL tears among female players.

There is limited publicly available research and few market products that address the unique anatomical and functional needs of female players, especially in firm-ground cleats.

Our team needed to balance competing requirements: maintaining traction and performance for competitive play, while reducing knee-joint stress and improving safety — all under constraints of manufacturability and realistic footwear design.

## Solution

We conducted biomechanical and anatomical research to understand how outsole geometry, stud layout, and traction influence stress on the knees in female athletes. This informed redesign principles tailored to female biomechanics.

Using CAD modeling, we created new outsole designs with altered stud configurations, geometries, and material selections to reduce rotational traction and mitigate risky torque during cuts and pivots. We altered the infill density, and therefore the hardness, at various parts of the sole.

We built and tested prototype outsoles made from 3D printed TPU, collecting mechanical and performance data (traction, flexibility, deformation under load), and evaluated failure modes. Testing was done using a VR tracking system that recorded the position of hip, knee, and ankle joints. We compared these results to regular outsoles and our TPU printed outsoles.

We documented our design process, test plans, and results — delivering a full design package, design documentation, and a recommendation for future production-ready cleat manufacturing.

## Key Learnings

- **Biomechanics-informed design**: Leveraging literature on female knee injury risk and cleat biomechanics helped ground our design decisions in real injury data.

- **CAD & 3D modeling**: We used SolidWorks to develop and refine outsole geometry, enabling rapid concept iteration and visualization of how design changes would affect fit, stud placement, and interface with an upper shoe.

- **Iterative prototyping and testing**: Building and testing physical prototypes through VR and trackers allowed us to verify that theoretical gains (reduced traction-based rotational forces) translated to practical performance, and avoid sacrificing grip or stability. The challenges and lessons from 3D printing TPU were invaluable.

- **System-level thinking**: We considered how outsole design interacts with upper shoe fit, playing surface, athlete movement patterns, and manufacturing constraints — reinforcing that safety and performance require holistic design, not isolated tweaks.
