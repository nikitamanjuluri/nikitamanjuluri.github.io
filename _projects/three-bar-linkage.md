## Challenge

Initial testing revealed a critical flaw: our belt-driven system couldn't generate enough torque to reliably press the button. The transmission ratio was too low, causing the belt to slip when the linkage encountered resistance. Despite having a functional mechanism design, the power transmission system was inadequate for the task.

## Solution

Our first approach was to tighten the belt tension, but even maximum tension couldn't prevent slippage under load. Recognizing that the fundamental issue was our transmission ratio, we sourced a smaller drive gear from the shop. This increased the mechanical advantage of our system, delivering the torque needed to complete the button-pressing challenge within the one-minute time constraint.
