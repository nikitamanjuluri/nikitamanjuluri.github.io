## Challenge

During our initial testing, we identified that the transmission ratio was too low, causing our belt to slip under load. We learned our system lacked sufficient torque to overcome the mechanical resistance.

## Solution

We first tried to increase the tension in the belt, but the tension required for stable, reliable operation was still greater than what this configuration could maintain. Then, we turned to the gear ratio, rummaging through our shop to find a smaller diameter gear to increase our transmission ratio, successfully completing the objective.
