I'm a mechanical engineer specializing in **high-performance aerospace hardware**—from rocket landing gear systems and propulsion components to rapid prototyping and human spaceflight applications.

I bring a hands-on approach that combines **analytical design** with **build-floor problem-solving**, taking hardware from concept through manufacturing to testing. Whether it's optimizing a 300,000 lb load path or troubleshooting a belt transmission on the shop floor, I thrive at the intersection of engineering rigor and practical execution.

**Currently:** Designing structures and seals for Blue Origin's New Glenn landing gear  
**Previously:** Blue Origin Rotational Program, Relativity Space, Redwire Space: home

I’m a mechanical engineer with experience across rocket landing gear systems, propulsion development, rapid prototyping/3D printing, and human-spaceflight hardware, looking to expand beyond into hardware for humanity. 

I combine analytical design with practical build-floor troubleshooting to bring hardware from concept → manufacture → test. 

Currently working at Blue Origin, previously Relativity Space, Made in Space, and more.
