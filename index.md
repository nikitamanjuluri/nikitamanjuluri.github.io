I’m a mechanical engineer with experience across rocket landing gear systems, propulsion development, rapid prototyping/3D printing, and human-spaceflight hardware, looking to expand beyond into hardware for humanity. 

I combine analytical design with practical build-floor troubleshooting to bring hardware from concept → manufacture → test. 

Currently working at Blue Origin, previously Relativity Space, Made in Space, and more.
