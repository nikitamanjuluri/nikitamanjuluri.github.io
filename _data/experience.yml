      - Created a novel geometry to carry >300 kip indirect load paths within stock/tolerance constraints. Through iterative design and Ansys analysis, reduced mass to 60 lbs of titanium to withstand 500°F aerothermal constraints, incorporating inputs from structures and thermal protection systems teams
      - Transformed design to Powder Bed Fusion (PBF) printed variation to overcome stock size constraints
      - Designed & analyzed welded steel assemblies for landing gear test stand integration per GSE safety factors
      - Developed and tested multiple landing-gear bay seal concepts to mitigate aerothermal & pressure loads, performing leak-rate testing and pressure-decay calculations to conform to Equivalent Sharp Edge Orifice Diameter (ESEOD) standards

      - Leveraged Powder Bed Fusion to design flexible, efficient engine components in NX and compare the analyses to commercial counterparts
      - Designed and thermally/structurally simulated a PBF fuel feedline manifold for the Aeon-R engine, allowing for organic channels that reduced weight and lead times
      - Gathered subcomponents (fittings, sensors, valves, orifices, and filters) and requirements from stakeholders
      - Considered PBF manufacturing and machining while balancing print time, mass, temperature distributions, and stress concentrations.
